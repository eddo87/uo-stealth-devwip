    "Stealth API: Use FindCount() not GetFindCount()",
    "Stealth API: CloseSimpleGump must be iterated backwards",
    "Gump Parsing: 'Amount' field is plain text (GumpText), others are HTML (XmfHTMLGumpColor)",
    "Parsing Strategy: Group by Y-coordinate (Row) then identify by X-coordinate (Column)",
    "Large BOD Fix: Large BODs may visually report '0' amount; logic must 'steal' correct quantity from child components",
    "Material Inference: Small BODs often lack visual Material text (defaulting to Iron); logic must infer 'Leather' or 'Cloth' based on item type",
    "Visual Tolerance: Increased Y-axis tolerance (10px) is required to correctly group Amount text with Item names",
    "Tkinter UI: Tkinter must run in the main thread (using .run() / .mainloop()), not as a daemon thread, to avoid immediate termination.",
    "Inter-script Communication: The GUI and worker scripts communicate seamlessly by reading/writing to local JSON files (config and supplies).",
    "Crafting Gump IDs: Shard specific button IDs verified via diagnostic script -> Tinker Tools (23), Sewing Kit (44), Tongs (16).",
    "Crafting Reliability: Using a text/Cliloc search within the gump (text_in_gump) is much safer than blind waits and button presses.",
    "World Save Guard: checkWorldSave.py's world_save_guard() must be called inside all 'Wait()' loops, movement loops, and crafting loops to prevent stalling.",
    "Material IDs & Hues: Cloth uses both 0x1766 and 0x1767. Leather (0x1081) uses specific hues: Normal (0x0000), Spined (0x08AC), Horned (0x0845), Barbed (0x0851)."
