    "Parsing Strategy: Group by Y-coordinate (Row) then identify by X-coordinate (Column)",
    "Large BOD Fix: Large BODs may visually report '0' amount; logic must 'steal' correct quantity from child components",
    "Material Inference: Small BODs often lack visual Material text (defaulting to Iron); logic must infer 'Leather' or 'Cloth' based on item type",
    "Visual Tolerance: Increased Y-axis tolerance (10px) is required to correctly group Amount text with Item names"
